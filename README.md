Hangperson: Developed using a scaffolded from an ESaaS assignment by Armando Fox and Nick Herson
=================================================================================================

Hangperson is the same game as Hangman, but meant to include a broader scope of people range who play the game. This was a homework assignment that I worked on during a web programming class.

Key takeaways
==============
-Importance of BDD and TDD during development
-Service-Oriented-Architecture
-Adapting a non-SaaS application to a SaaS environment 

What I developed:
=================

-All the methods that determine the game logic, first as a standalone component from the SaaS project and then   intergrating it into the SaaS framework
-Mapping resource routes to HTTP requests


Tests
=================
All 18 are passing

Pre-existing:
=================
   -Scaffold including: BDD tests and guiding instructions to help complete the assignment
